Building blocks for message queues solutions in Go

This is a **work in progress**.

This is an exercise to see what I could do in Go regarding networking and also to learn a bit more about Go.

The idea is that one client endpoint connects to a server endpoint,
and as soon the connection is established you can send and receive messages in either endpoint.
Also a server can act as a router/broker for messages between clients.

This is loosely inspired by [zeromq](http://zeromq.org/)

Features
-
* Publish/Subscribe
* Push/Pull
* Request/Reply (single or multiple replies)
* RequestAll/Reply (multiple endpoints replying)
* Message Filters
* Client Groups

The following example show a simple message bus.
Three clients connect to a server, and one of them publishs a message that will be received by the other two.

```go
server := gomsg.NewServer()
 // route all messages between the clients
server.Route("*", time.Second, nil)
server.Listen(":7777")

cli1 := gomsg.NewClient()
cli1.Handle("HELLO", func(m string) {
	fmt.Println("[1] Hello", m)
})
cli1.Connect("localhost:7777")

cli2 := gomsg.NewClient()
cli2.Handle("HELLO", func(m string) {
	fmt.Println("[2] Hello", m)
})
cli2.Connect("localhost:7777")

cli := gomsg.NewClient()
cli.Connect("localhost:7777")

cli.Publish("HELLO", "World")

// give time for things to happen
time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)

```

Another nice feature is possibility of grouping clients.

If a client identifies the group that it belongs the server will only send the message
to one of the clients. This way we can have the server publish messages and have the clients
decide if they want to behave like Publish/Subscribe (ungrouped) or like Push/Push (grouped).

```go
server := gomsg.NewServer()
server.Listen(":7777")
server.Route("*", time.Second, nil)

// Group HA subscriber
cli := gomsg.NewClient()
cli.Handle("HELLO", func(m string) {
	fmt.Println("<=== [1] processing:", m)
})
cli.SetGroupId("HA")
cli.Connect("localhost:7777")

// Group HA subscriber
cli2 := gomsg.NewClient()
cli2.Handle("HELLO", func(m string) {
	fmt.Println("<=== [2] processing:", m)
})
cli2.SetGroupId("HA")
cli2.Connect("localhost:7777")

// publisher
cli3 := gomsg.NewClient()
cli3.Connect("localhost:7777")

// Only one element of the group HA will process
// each message, alternately (round robin).
cli3.Publish("HELLO", "Hello World!")
cli3.Publish("HELLO", "OlÃ¡ Mundo!")
cli3.Publish("HELLO", "YESSSS!")
cli3.Publish("HELLO", "one")
cli3.Publish("HELLO", "two")
cli3.Publish("HELLO", "three")
cli3.Publish("HELLO", "test")

time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)
```
